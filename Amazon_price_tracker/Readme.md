Amazon Price Tracker 


Amazon price tracker monitors a product and alerts you by sending an email when the product is available at a certain price, helping you decide when to buy. 

In this project we are tracking the price of the HP 15s laptop(product link-https://www.amazon.in/HP-i3-1115G4-Micro-Edge-Anti-Glare-15s-fq2673TU/dp/B0B4N6JVMW/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?rid=2IHEU9TA4UB71&keywords=laptop&qid=1673609726&sprefix=%2Caps%2C5596&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1).


We would like to be notified when the price of the laptop is below Rs 50000.The code will track the price of the product every 5hours and will send an email once the price of the laptop will be below Rs 50000.
We have used two diffrent emails for testing
