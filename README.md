Snake Game:
The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game challenging.
The controls are the arrow keys:
Up arrow:For moving the snake in the upward direction
Down arrow: For moving the snake in the downward direction
Left arrow:For moving the snake towards left.
Right arrow:For moving the snake towards right.
