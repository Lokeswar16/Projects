This is a musical time machine it will help you feel nostalgic listening to the top 100 songs of the year which you want to time travel to,when you type the date you want to travel to in YYYY-MM-DD format a spotify playlist will be created which consists of the Global top 100 songs of that year.
I have made this project using python libraries Beautiful Soup and Spotipy.
Happy listening
